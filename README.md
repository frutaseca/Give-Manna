# Give Manna

## What is Give Manna
We are Give Manna, we are a community based organization that supports Non-Profit Church Organizations.

## Description
Users are able to find information on non profit organization, they will be able to check weather for the location of the non profit organization and check what foods are used and then those food can be donated to the non profit organization.
We have learned how to use different APIs rather than ones previously learned, we used a different CSS libary than bootstrap we used Materialize, learned how to put information from an API into local storage we help speed up fetch queues.
Some future improvements to the site that we want to put are adding forms for users to put food that they would like to see being given out and a place to simply order it from the website.

## User Story
